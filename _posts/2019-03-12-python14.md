# About machine learning


# install opencv and numpy
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

```
sudo apt-get update 

```
and then

```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev 
sudo apt-get install libcblas-dev
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev  
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4  
sudo apt-get install libqt4-test  
sudo pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.2.17 

```
 

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


# face detection using harr cascade
Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video and based on the concept of ​​ features.
(It is proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.)
Don't need to know how Harr casecade works in this stage, but we do need haar casecade to make pi detect objects. 

Go to https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.
download files
1. haarcascade_eye.xml  
https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_eye.xml  
2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml  
(https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)  

Save them in the folder you are working.   

# face detection python code  
```pythoh
import numpy as np
import cv2

#loading cascade file
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
eye_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_eye.xml')

#webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, img = cap.read()
    #convert color
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    #parameters for size of face
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)

    # to draw rectangle around face
    for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    #x,y starting point, (x+w,y+h) ending point,  red color rectangle
        cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
        #find gray only insde face size
        #[y:y+h, x:x+w] regin of face - staring poing, ending point 
        roi_gray = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        # color of faec
        roi_color = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        
        eyes = eye_cascade.detectMultiScale(roi_gray)
        # to draw rectangle around eye
        for (ex,ey,ew,eh) in eyes:
            cv2.rectangle(roi_color,(ex,ey),(ex+ew,ey+eh),(0,255,0),2)

    cv2.imshow('img',img)
    k = cv2.waitKey(30) & 0xff
    if k == 27:
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
