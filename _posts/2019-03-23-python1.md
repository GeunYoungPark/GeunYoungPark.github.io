# Vairables  
1. make workplace  
2. create file -> hello_world.py  

```python  
# file Name : hello_world.py 
message = "Hello Python world!"  
print(message)  
```  
3. rules

 * Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.   
   😎 which one is correct?   
    message_1    or    1_message. 
 * Variable names can not contain spaces but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names.   
   😎 which one is correct?   
   `greeting_message`  or `greeting message`   
 * Variable names can not use **Python keywords** and **function names**   
   😎 Search “Python Keywords and Built-in Functions” 
 * Variable names should be **short** but descriptive. 
 * Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
 * When vaieable name is typed wrong, NameError will be occured. 
   😎 Make any NameError on purpose.    
  

# Comment
```python  
# This #key is a comment mark. 
message = "Hello Python world!"  
print(message)  
```  


# Data types

## Strings   
1. a series of characters   
2. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python   
3. important string methods   
    * Changing Case  
```python  
# file Name : name.py   
name = "ada lovelace"  
print(name.title())  
```    

   😎  Test :   
   print(name.upper())  
   print(name.lower())  

   * combining (concatenation) strings in variables   

```python  
# file Name : name.py   
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```    
4. error message   
`SyntaxError: invalid syntax `

## Numbers
😎  open python terminal and do this:
2+3  
3-2  
3/2  
2*3  
2**3  
(2+3)*2  

*  Types of number
    integer  
    float
