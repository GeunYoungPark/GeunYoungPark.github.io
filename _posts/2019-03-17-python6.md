**How to setup Pipenv & Virtual Environments**   

Why do you need to isolate your python dependencies?  

> Almost every Data Scientist or Developer who has worked on any project, who has used python packages have had to deal with different versions of packages across different branches and projects. Your system dependencies based on python may be broken if you decide to play with python packages on your system. And nobody wants that. Virtual Environments make this process easier.

For windows 10 users, follow this instruction.  
Link : https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/  

Make sure to change your system path and log out to make the path effective.  

For Mac users,   

```
cd  
mkdir pyworkshop  
cd pyworkshop  
python3.7 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  

```

To exit your virtualenv just type “deactivate”.





 **How to know if virtualenv is installed?** 
```virtualenv --version```
