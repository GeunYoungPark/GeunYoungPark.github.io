## Passing File name to read
**Bad pracrtice : HARD CODING** means putting some bit of information that should come from the user as a string directly in our source code. That’s bad because we want it to load other files later. The solution for our example is to use argv or input to ask the user what file to open instead of ”hard coding” the file’s name. 

1. Some command reagarding file handling. 
- close – Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
- read – Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
- readline – Reads just one line of a text file.
- truncate – Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
- write('stuff') – Writes ”stuff” to the file.
- seek(0) – Move the read/write location to the beginning of the file.
2. make one file:  
drill6.py
3. type code below  

```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print(f"Firstly, We're going to empty {filename}.")
print("If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).")
print("If you do want that, hit RETURN.")
input("?")

print("Opening the file...")
target = open(filename, 'w')
print("Truncating the file.!")
target.truncate()
print("dond!")

print("Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.")
line1 = input("line 1: ")
line2 = input("line 2: ")
line3 = input("line 3: ")

print("I'm going to write these to the file.")
target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")
print("And finally, we close it.")
target.close() 
```
4. execute file : python3 drill6.py test.txt

## Better way
Google "Configuration file" . 
Google "Configuration Languge".  
Some example which are widely used are YML, JSON, XML and CSV.  
Google **network packet**  

## Check if the File is exist?
1. make file : drill7.py
2. type code below
```python
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, file_name = argv
print(f"Does the output file exist?") 
print(f"{exists(file_name)}")

```
3. Remember **if** statement? Change code to answer by saying yes or no. 

```python
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, file_name = argv
print(f"Does the output file exist?") 
if exists(file_name):
    print("Yes")
else: 
    print("No")

```
