1. About Network : NBN, IPv4, Ipv6, wifi
    * NBN stands for National broad band network
    * The term broadband commonly refers to high-speed Internet access that is always on and aster than the traditional dial-up access. 
    * There are several way to provide NBN service but optical fiber cable is fastest connection thus far. 
2. About Internet, Server and client
    * The Internet (portmanteau of interconnected network) is the **global system of interconnected 
    computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)** to link devices worldwide
    * The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of **communications protocols** used in the Internet and similar computer networks. 
    * Clientâ€“server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.  ![alt text](https://cdn.techterms.com/img/lg/client-server_model_1253.png "client-server model")
    * A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols

3. About Domain and webhosting services (we will use github for free)
    * When referring to an Internet address or name a domain or domain name is the location of a website. For example, the domain name "google.com" points to the IP address "216.58.216.164". Generally, it's easier to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers.

    * Web hosting provides space and access for your website on the Internet
Before visitors can view your website, it must be published on a webserver. This is done by uploading all the files of your website. Webpages are made up of HTML and JavaScript, and images and videos and fonts. All of these must be uploaded to your web host so that they can be accessed by your visitors. A web hosting service provides the space for these files, and allows them to be accessed over the Internet.
