1. structure of python  
    - You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. 

```python
    # Define a function `plus()`
    def plus(a,b):
    return a + b
```
    - use Autocomplete to bring codesnippet in VS!! IntelliSense quickly shows methods, class members, and documentation as you type, and you can trigger completions at any time with Ctrl+Space. You can also hover over identifiers for more information about them.
    We are using ms.python extension. Open extension window and check it out.

2. data type for number : Integer, Float
```python

    a = 5

    # Output: <class 'int'>
    print(type(a))

    # Output: <class 'float'>
    print(type(5.0))

```
3. Data structure
[Data structure document link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)
    - In programming, an array is a collection of elements of the same type. Python doesn't have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily.
    
```python
# An example that uses most of the list methods:
>>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']
>>> fruits.count('apple')
2
>>> fruits.count('tangerine')
0
>>> fruits.index('banana')
3
>>> fruits.index('banana', 4)  # Find next banana starting a position 4
6
>>> fruits.reverse()
>>> fruits
['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange']
>>> fruits.append('grape')
>>> fruits
['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']
>>> fruits.sort()
>>> fruits
['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear']
>>> fruits.pop()
```

    - set : Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
```python
>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
True
>>> 'crabgrass' in basket
False

>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
...
>>> a = set('abracadabra')
>>> b = set('alacazam')
>>> a                                  # unique letters in a
{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
{'r', 'd', 'b'}
>>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both
{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
{'a', 'c'}
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}

# Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:
>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
>>> a
{'r', 'd'}

```

4. python example : find facor

5. example : find common factors
```python
"""
To find common least numbers, input 2 different numbers with comma. 

1. Find the factors of an integer
2. compare 2 sets of numbers and select all of same numbers. 
"""
def factors(b):
    x = set()
    for i in range(1, b+1):
        if b%i == 0:
            x.add(i)
    return x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num = input('Input number (ex 10, 5) ')
    x,y = [int(i) for i in num.split(',')]
    arry_x = factors(x)
    arry_y = factors(y)
    print(arry_x & arry_y)

```
