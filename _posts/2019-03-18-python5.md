1. structure of python  
    - You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. 

    ```python
        # Define a function `plus()`
        def plus(a,b):
        return a + b
    ```
    - use Autocomplete to bring codesnippet in VS!! IntelliSense quickly shows methods, class members, and documentation as you type, and you can trigger completions at any time with Ctrl+Space. You can also hover over identifiers for more information about them.
    We are using ms.python extension. Open extension window and check it out.

2. data type for number : Integer, Float  

    ```python
        a = 5

        # Output: <class 'int'>
        print(type(a))

        # Output: <class 'float'>
        print(type(5.0))

    ```  

3. Data structure  

    [Data structure document link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)  
    
    1. In programming, an array is a collection of elements of the same type. Python doesn't have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily.
        
    ```python
    # An example that uses most of the list methods:
    >>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']
    >>> fruits.count('apple')
    2
    >>> fruits.count('tangerine')
    0
    >>> fruits.index('banana')
    3
    >>> fruits.index('banana', 4)  # Find next banana starting a position 4
    6
    >>> fruits.reverse()
    >>> fruits
    ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange']
    >>> fruits.append('grape')
    >>> fruits
    ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']
    >>> fruits.sort()
    >>> fruits
    ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear']
    >>> fruits.pop()
    ```  

    2. set : Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.  

    ```python
    >>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
    >>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
    {'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
    >>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
    True
    >>> 'crabgrass' in basket
    False
    # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
    >>> a = set('abracadabra')
    >>> b = set('alacazam')
    >>> a                                  # unique letters in a
    {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
    >>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
    {'r', 'd', 'b'}
    >>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both
    {'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
    >>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
    {'a', 'c'}
    >>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
    {'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
    # Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:
    >>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}
    >>> a
    {'r', 'd'}
    ```

5. example : find common factors  

```python
"""
To find common least numbers, input 2 different numbers with comma. 

1. Find the factors of an integer
2. compare 2 sets of numbers and select all of same numbers. 
"""
def plus(a, b):
    return a + b

def is_factor(a, b):
    if a%b == 0 :       
        return True
    else:    
        return False

def find_factor(myNumber):
    """ this is function to find factors of parameter"""
    myResult = set() 
    for i in range(1, myNumber+1):
         if is_factor(myNumber, i):
                myResult.add(i)
    return myResult         

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = int( input("input first number :  ") )
    num2 = int( input("input second number : "))
    output_1 = find_factor(num1)
    output_2 = find_factor(num2)
    output = output_1 & output_2
for value in output:
    print(" common factor  of {0} and {1} is {2} ".format( num1, num2,  value))
``` 

6. sorting  

    Reference : https://www.learnpython.dev/02-introduction-to-python/080-advanced-datatypes/10-lists/   

    **Sorting a Copy Of Your List**  

    If you’d like sort to return a brand new copy of your list, instead of modifying your original copy, you can use the built-in sorted(my_list) function on your list to return a new list, sorted in increasing (ascending) order. Or use sorted(my_list, reverse=True) to create a new list sorted backwards, in decreasing (or descending) order. This operation will not modify the underlying list.  

    Either of these operations will return a ___new list___.  
    
    ```python  
    >>> lottery_numbers = [1, 4, 32423, 2, 45, 11]
    >>> sorted(lottery_numbers)
    [1, 2, 4, 11, 45, 32423]
    >>> lottery_numbers
    [1, 4, 32423, 2, 45, 11]
    >>> sorted(lottery_numbers, reverse=True)
    [32423, 45, 11, 4, 2, 1]
    >>> lottery_numbers
    [1, 4, 32423, 2, 45, 11]  
    ```  

    **Sorting the list in-place**  
    You can call my_list.sort() on your list to sort it in increasing (ascending) order, or my_list.sort(reverse=True) on the list to sort it backwards, in decreasing (or descending) order. This operation will modify the underlying list, and doesn’t return a value.

    ```python    
    >>> lottery_numbers = [1, 4, 32423, 2, 45, 11]
    >>> lottery_numbers.sort()
    >>> lottery_numbers
    [1, 2, 4, 11, 45, 32423]

    >>> lottery_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    >>> lottery_numbers
    [32423, 45, 11, 4, 2, 1]

    >>> words = ["Umbrella", "Fox", "Apple"]
    >>> words.sort()
    >>> words
    ['Apple', 'Fox', 'Umbrella']
    ```  

    **Reverse the list in-place**  
    To reverse the items of a list in-place, call my_list.reverse() on it.  

    ```python  
    >>> lottery_numbers = [1, 4, 32423, 2, 45, 11]
    >>> lottery_numbers.reverse()
    >>> lottery_numbers
    [11, 45, 2, 32423, 4, 1]
    ```
