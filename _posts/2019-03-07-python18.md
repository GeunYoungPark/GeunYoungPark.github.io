```
2. Download and install the latest Python 3.7 source
```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/Python-3.7.4.tar.xz
 tar xf Python-3.7.4.tar.xz
 cd Python-3.7.4
 ./configure
 make -j 4
 sudo make altinstall
```

3. How to use?
```

# Chapter 3. priting, prompting and passing
## print multiple line using escape sequences 
1. make one file:  
drill2.py
2. type code below  

```python
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print("Here are the days: ", days)
print("Here are the months: ", months)
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""")
```  




## triple-quotes
The triple-quotes, which is just """ and works like a string, but you can put
as many lines of text as you want until you type """ again. 


## Escape Sequences
This is all of the escape sequences Python supports. You may not use many of these, but memorize their
format and what they do anyway. Try them out in some strings to see if you can make them work.
Escape What it does.
```
\\ Backslash (\)
\' Single-quote (’)
\" Double-quote (”)
\n ASCII linefeed (LF)
\r Carriage Return (CR)
```

---
## What is CR and LF?
The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). 
For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note **the end of a line**, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. In the HTTP protocol, the CR-LF sequence is always used to **terminate a line**.

## prompting
1. make one file:  
drill3.py
2. type code below  
```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
```

## argument

1. make file : drill4.py
2. type code below  
```python
# ”import.” This is how you add predefined features/functions to your script from the Python modules.
from sys import argv
# The argv is the ”argument variable,” a very standard name in programming that you will find used in many other languages. This variable holds the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it.

# ”unpacks” argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with: script, first, second, and third. This may look strange, but ”unpack” is probably the best word to describe what it does. 
# It just says, ”Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order.”
script, first, second, third = argv

print("The script is called:", script)
print("Your first variable is:", first)
print("Your second variable is:", second)
print("Your third variable is:", third)
```
4. execute code  
> python drill4.py 10 20 30

## reading files
Let's pass bigger values to python. 

1. make new file : drill5.py
2. make 2 text file
For example : avengers.txt and endgame.txt 
2. type code below
```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv
txt = open(filename)
print(f"Here's your file {filename}:")
print(txt.read())
print("Type the filename again:")
file_again = input("> ")
txt_again = open(file_again)
print(txt_again.read())
```
3. execute code 
> python drill5.py avengers.txt
