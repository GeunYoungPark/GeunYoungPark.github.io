**Equipment List**
    - Raspberry Pi 3
    - Micro SD Card and installed Rasberrian
    - Xbox Controller

1. update apt-get  
    To get the latest version of apt-get, enter the following command into your terminal. It will take some time. 
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```
2. Optional step : Installing Xbox driver  
    To avoid possisble issues and not to tear off your hair, this step is recommended. Installing Xbox driver will not cause any harm and will make sure pairing is successful.  
    ```
    sudo apt-get install xboxdrv
    ```
    Xbox One controllers to __do not support Enhanced Re-Transmission Mode (ERTM)__, something enabled by default on the Raspberry Pi. With ERTM enabled the Xbox Controller wonâ€™t pair correctly. If you have other devices that require this functionality you should not use be using Xbox One Controllers on a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth, and instead use the Xbox wireless adapter or a USB cable.

    To turn off ETRM mode, type in:
    ```
    sudo bash -c echo 1 > /sys/module/bluetooth/parameters/disable_ertm
    ```
    But you may have some issues to use the methods like bash doesn't have a permission or it may need to run the command every time to use Xbox gamepad. (Read this [page](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroPie/comments/aakkop/xbox_one_s_controller_disable_ertm_persist_on/))  

    This is another way to turn off ertm.  

    1. Create a new file using nano...
        ```
        sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/bluetooth.conf
        ```
    2. Add a single line to the new file...
        ```
        options bluetooth disable\_ertm=Y
        ``` 
    3. Exit nano, saving the file in the process. (Ctrl+X and enter)


3. connect xbox controller to pi  
    - Let's launch bluetooth control application. 
        ```
        sudo bluetoothctl
        power on
        agent on
        default-agent
        ```
    - let's scan for available devices. First input the following command to scan devices.
        ```
        scan on
        ```  
    - Turn on Xbox controller. There is a small button on its head. Push it and the button will start to flash. when bluetooth application find xbox device and it whill shows this kind of entry on your termonal. 
        ```
        [NEW] Device B8:27:EB:A4:59:08 Wireless Controller
        ```
    - __Whireless controller__ means Xbox. "B8:27:EB:A4:59:08" This code is called MAC address. 
    With the MAC address, we can make a connection. Type the following command.
        ```
        connect YOUR_MAC_Address
        ```
    - Once the connection is successful, UUIDs will be poped up and it lookes like this.  
        ```
        Attempting to connect to B8:27:EB:A4:59:08
        [CHG] Device B8:27:EB:A4:59:08 Modalias: usb:v054Cp0268d0100
        [CHG] Device B8:27:EB:A4:59:08 UUIDs:
                00001124-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
        ```
    - The last step is to make sure this connection is secured. Type in:
        ```
        trust YOUR_MAC_Address
        ```
    Now, the bluetooth connection is stored. To get out of blyuetoothctl application, type **Ctrl+D**.

4. Test communication between Xbox controller and pi
    Evdev is a software which is retrieving the raw data values, processing them and providing a set of handlers to use with the data. Let's install it using pip. (use ***pip3***)
    ```
    sudo pip3 install evdev
    ```  
    There is an test script which comes packaged with the Evdev to check out the functionality:
    ```
    python Your_local_python/dist-packages/evdev/evtest.py
    ```
5. Mapping controller
    When you execute evtest, you will see this 3 things
* ecode type: Depending on the type of input it could be relative (REL), absolute (ABS), or some other type
* event code: This is a unique code to determine which control has triggered an event
* event value: This tells us the value of the control so we can act accordingly  

Let's make new python file and run this code. Then, make a note of the event codes whenever you push buttons on Xbox controller. This code shows data that is triggered by key event. Now you can analyze them.  

* To find accessible event devices   

```python
import evdev

devices = [evdev.InputDevice(path) for path in evdev.list_devices()]
for device in devices:
    print(device.path, device.name, device.phys)
/dev/input/event1    Dell Dell USB Keyboard   usb-0000:00:12.1-2/input0
/dev/input/event0    Dell USB Optical Mouse   usb-0000:00:12.0-2/input0
```    

* To read events  

```python
#import evdev
from evdev import InputDevice, categorize, ecodes

#creates object 'gamepad' to store the data 
#before execute this code, check event device first.
gamepad = InputDevice('/dev/input/event3')

#prints out device info at start
print(gamepad)

#evdev takes care of polling the controller in a loop
for event in gamepad.read_loop():
    print(categorize(event))
```
5. Sample code
> Before we write codes, we need to decode all gamepad actions and this sample code will help you to test your gamepad. 

    ```python
    #import evdev
    from evdev import InputDevice, categorize, ecodes

    #creates object 'gamepad' to store the data
    #you can call it whatever you like
    gamepad = InputDevice('/dev/input/event3')

    #button code variables 
    yBtn = 308
    upBtn = 46

    #prints out device info at start
    print(gamepad)

    #loop and filter by event code and print the mapped label
    for event in gamepad.read_loop():
        if event.type == ecodes.EV_KEY:
            if event.value == 1:
                if event.code == yBtn:
                    print("Y")
    ```                
6. The **python-evdev** packages provides bidings to the generic input event interface in Linux. The evdev interface serves the purpose of passing events generated in the kernel directly to userspace through character devices that are typically located in ```/dev/input/```. In other words, evdev package allows you to read and write input of devices that is connected to your linex system.  
Search evdev API on google and look into its documents. 
Refer to **Listing device capabilities**
Check out list of event code for your Xbox Contoller. Test this code in python repl(or consol). 
![python repl](/assets/img/python7-img1.jpg)
```python
>>> import evdev
>>> device
>>> device.capabilites(verbose=True) # this returns  the event type as a mapping of surpported event types to lists of handled event codes. 
```
