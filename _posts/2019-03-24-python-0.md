2. About Visual studio code  
  1. Key fearures for python programing : debugging, git control(version control system ), code linters, FTP, SSH  
  2. language support : code snippet, syntax highlight, brace matching, code folding  


3. Customizing visual studio code  
  * color theme : open command pallet by ctrl+shft+p or click bottom down left button. type color theme
  * font size :
  open command pallet > type setting > search fontsize > change size in editor  
  * select text : shift + end
  * multi line selection : 
    * alt + click  
    * alt + ctrl + arrow down  
  * line move : alt + arrow up or down
  * change all occurences  
    * select one word. 
    * r-click to bring popup menu 
    * select 'change all occurences'

4. Extensions 
  1. install coder runner
  2. Markdown Preview Github Styling
  3. install ftp : ftp-simple   
      __how to do Settings__ 
        * Press 'F1'   
        * Enter 'ftp-simple'

  * formatting  
    * open `test-f.py`
    * select all texts
    * right click
    * select format selection
    * if your vs doesn't have autopep8, recomendation message will be appared and just click it. 
    * After install autopep8, try 'format selection'
  * python coding convention : https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds 

6. How to run python code 
  right click - select run

      How to troubleshoot the GoPiGo3
      
      If the GoPiGo3 is not performing as expected, here are some things to try:
      
      - Run the troubleshooting script `all_tests.sh`. You can run the troubleshooting script by running this:
              sudo bash /home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Troubleshooting/all_tests.sh
      - Look through the output to see if there's anything unexpected. 
      - If you don't find the problem, you can upload the `log.txt` file from the desktop (`/home/pi/Desktop/log.txt`) 
        to the [forums] and ask for help (please give a clear description of the problem you're experiencing).

    * [Tutorials - Basic » 3.1. Driving Around](https://gopigo3.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials-basic/driving.html#forward-r-l-backward)  
    * Source code : easy_Motors.py

8. How to set static ip address in Raspberry Pi
  * sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
  * add 4 lines below in dhcpcd.conf file
      * interface wlan0
      * static ip_address=10.1.1.64/24
      * static routers=10.1.1.1
      * static domain_name_servers=10.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::1
  * `10.1.1.1` is gateway address
  * Find gateway address - use “netstat -nr” command


  
__😎Python syntax__  
* module   
 : In programming, a module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for the game logic, and another module would be responsible for drawing the game on the screen. 

   > mygame/  
   > mygame/game.py  
   > mygame/draw.py   

 Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately. Modules in Python are simply Python files with a `.py` extension. __The name of the module will be the name of the file.__ A Python module can have a set of functions, classes or variables defined and implemented. 
 Modules are imported from other modules using the __import__ command.  

* package   
 : Packages are namespaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist. Each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called `__init__.py`. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
