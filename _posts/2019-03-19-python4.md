1. uninstall python 2.7    
    - At terminal, to find python type : `type python`    
    - To know which binary of python is used : `which python`     
        - Given that python2.7 is used when you type python --version    
        - the output may be /Library/Frameworks/Pythib.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2    
        - (if it is aliased it may be /usr/bin/python)    
    - To Go to the directory /Library/Frameworks/Pythib.framework/Versions,    
        - open Finder    
        - Command+shift+G and type the directory route    
        - You will see folder named "2.7"    
    - open terminal and check current directory is  /Library/Frameworks/Pythib.framework/Versions    
        - remove "python 2.7" folder    
        - `sudo rm -rf 2.7`    
    - Go to /usr/local/bin <--- The user can remove files in this folder.  but you may not remove files in /usr/bin folder    

2. install pip on python3    
    - what is pip : pip is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers.              
    - To know pip is installed : `type pip`   
    - if python2 pip is used and you are not using python2.7 any more, just delete it.    

3. alias     
    - `alias python=python3`     
    - To make this alias permanant, go to /usr/bin and type in: `nano .bash_profile`    
    - go to end of the file and type `alias python=python3`
