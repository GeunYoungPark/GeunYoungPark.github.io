# WHILE Loop

for loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. In contrast, statement with the ''while'' loop is used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever.

Example of while loop:  

```python
#count.py
current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1
```
Can you see the result? Tell me~!ðŸ˜€
