# For loop 
The for loop is a generic sequence iterator in Python: it can step through the items in any ordered sequence object.  

![tutoriaslpoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/loop_architecture.jpg)

```python
for <target> in <object>: # Assign object items to target
    <statements> # Repeated loop body: use target
else:
    <statements> # If we didn't hit a 'break'
```

# Turtle  
: Turtle is simple python drawing program.   

[Tutorial -Turtle examples ](https://michael0x2a.com/blog/turtle-examples)   
[turtle document](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)   

**To install**
`pip install turtles`

1. Draw a line  

```python
# Step 1: Make all the "turtle" commands available to us.
import turtle

# Step 2: Create a new turtle. We'll call it "bob"
bob = turtle.Turtle()

# Step 3: Move in the direction Bob's facing for 50 pixels
bob.forward(50)

# Step 4: We're done!
turtle.done()
```
2.  Drawing a square (using loops)

```python
import turtle 

smart = turtle.Turtle()

# Loop 4 times. Everything I want to repeat is 
# *indented* by four spaces.
for i in range(4):
    smart.forward(50)
    smart.right(90)
    
# This isn't indented, so we aren't repeating it.
turtle.done()
```

3. Drawing a star  

```python
import turtle 

star = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(50):
    star.forward(50)
    star.right(144)
    
turtle.done()
```

4. Spiraling star  

```python
import turtle 

spiral = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(20):
    spiral.forward(i * 10)
    spiral.right(144)
    
turtle.done()

```

##  Make gopigo program to move your car in star shape!
Methods you will need:
- EasyGoIiGo3 : forward , stop, drive_cm, turn_degrees
- time.sleep
