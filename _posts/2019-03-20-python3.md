# While Loop

for loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. In contrast, statement with the ''while'' loop is used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever.

Example of while loop:  

```python
#count.py
current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1
```
Can you see the result? Tell me~!ðŸ˜€


# Gopigo project 
## Increasing speed  
```python
from easygopigo3 import EasyGoPiGo3
from time import time, sleep

gpg = EasyGoPiGo3()

# setting speed to lowest value and
# calculating the step increase in speed
current_speed = 50
end_speed = 400
step = (end_speed - current_speed) / 20
gpg.set_speed(current_speed)

# start moving the robot at an ever increasing speed
gpg.forward()
while current_speed <= end_speed:
  sleep(0.1)
  gpg.set_speed(current_speed)
  current_speed += step

# and then stop it
gpg.stop()

```
